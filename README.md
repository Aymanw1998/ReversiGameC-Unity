# ReversiGameUnity

## History:
- Reversi is a strategy board game for two players, played on an 8Ã—8 uncheckered board. It was invented in 1883. Othello, a variant with a change to the board's initial setup, was patented in 1971.

## Rules of the Game:
- 1) Parts of the game: 
  - A checkerboard with m x n squares (the number is usually 8 by 8), black and white discs representing circles. 
  - In box sets containing the game, there are usually m x n discs that on the one hand are white and on the other hand, are black. 
  - This game is very common both on a computer and online.
- 2) The objective of the game: 
  - Turn the color of the opponent's tool to your color, by closing them with tools in your color. 
  - Closing means demarcating a row, column, or diagonal of circles in the opponent's color from both ends in circles of your color. 
  - For example: if there is a black circle next to a white circle, the black players in turn will be able to place a black circle next to the white (so that a row of 3 circles is formed), and turn it black.
- 3) Game rules: 
  - The game takes turns. 
  - The opening stand is 4 circles in the center, 2 for each. 
  - Each player is free to put a circle of his color anywhere available according to his choice. 
  - The player can only play if he can place his tool in the place next to the tool that is already on the board.
- 4) End of the game: 
  - The game ends in one of two modes:
    1. When the whole board is filled or when there are no further possible moves to either side, the winner is the one who has more circles in his color.
    2. When all the tools on the board are the same color, even if the board is not full, the player of that color is the winner.
